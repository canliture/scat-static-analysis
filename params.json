{"name":"SCAT","tagline":"Static Code Analysis Tool for PHP application","body":"### Welcome to SCAT page.\r\nSCAT is a new static analysis model prototype. The model is designed to discover the security problems in scripting languages such as PHP. The concepts presented in the proposed model are implemented in prototype: SCAT.\r\nSCAT is a Static Code Analysis Tool.  SCAT applies the phases of the proposed model to catch security vulnerabilities in PHP 5.3. The prototype is implemented in java and outputs reports in HTML format. It is designed to detect most of known taint-style security vulnerabilities, as it includes a custom PHP parser, which is able to understand the syntax of PHP 5 through PHP 5.3. The proposed model also includes visualization features such as the ability of exporting a visualized form of the generated parse tree and dependence graphs of tainted program points.\r\n\r\n### Main Features\r\n1-\tSupports PHP 5.3.\r\n2-\tControl-flow graph (CFG).\r\n3-\tData-flow analysis.\r\n4-\tTaint- Style vulnerabilities detection:\t\r\na.\tXSS.\r\nb.\tSQL injection.\r\nc.      Header injections.\r\nd.      code/command execution.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nSCAT is an open source tool, feel free to download the tool and run it using any Java IDE.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to send an email if you have any questions or further inquires. \r\nplease e-mail: MonaNashaat@eng.psu.edu.com.","google":"UA-62199635-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
